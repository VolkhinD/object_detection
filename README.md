# Object Detection, The Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset

This is a classic object detection problem solved with PyTorch and timm. Dataset website: https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/pets/
Annotations stored separatly (with different url link) and written in XML format. In this work I extract data from website, extract annotations with xml.etree library, create Torch dataset and train model from timm with pretrained weights.
